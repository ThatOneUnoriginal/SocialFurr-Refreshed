# About
SocialFurr Refreshed is a User Style/Theme that modifies and removes certain aspects of the SocialFurr website with the intention of providing an overal better exerpeience for the user. The theme is designed for dark mode exclusively as some of the colour modifications don't translate well to a light theme environment (like the hover animations.)

PS: In the future a light mode tailored version may be provided. And if I somehow manage to understand how to get conditional/if statements to work on stylus (I've been desperately trying) then possibly one singular theme that'd work on both themes without having to change anything (or at least not having to change between two seperate stylus themes.)

# Intallation
Install the Stylus extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Chrome/Chromium Based Browsers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) 

You can find the SocialFurr Refreshed Theme on UserStyles.World by going [here](https://userstyles.world/style/12618/socialfurr-refreshed). On this page, scroll down until you see a "Install" button. Once clicked it will direct you to the Stylus sytle installation screen, on this simply click the "Install style" button. Note if you want to prevent it from activating on light mode (which it is not designed for) you can set it so that in only enables on "Dark."

# Known Issues
* Emoji and Media Icon on "Reply to Comment" Display as Default Red
* Microphone Icon on Comment Reply Turns White When Hovered (this appears to be an abnormality with the website itself)
